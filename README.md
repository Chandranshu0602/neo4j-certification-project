# Neo4j Certification Project

This is a simple project to demonstrate a basic understanding of Neo4j and Cypher. It shows how to load data from a CSV file and run simple queries.

### Files

* `characters.csv`: A simple CSV file with sample character data.
* `script.cypher`: A Cypher script that loads the data from the CSV, creates nodes and relationships, and runs two example queries.

### How to Use

The `script.cypher` can be run in a Neo4j instance (like Neo4j Desktop or AuraDB) to build and query the graph. The `LOAD CSV` command pulls the data directly from this GitHub repository.
